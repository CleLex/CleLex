# CleLex
CleLex started as a little practise for a degree's subject, and we've still feeding it with code to grow it up. 
Simply, is a software that cleans your code, tabulates it, deletes little lexic mistakes, etc. At this moment, only works on c and c++, but we are working so it can works too in Java.

We are going to make it more accesible by including it on a website, and making a downloable version of the software.

We are opened to every idea you give us, and if you want to contribute, contact us :)
